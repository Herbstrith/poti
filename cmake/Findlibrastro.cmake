# Find the PAJENG library

# PAJENG_INCLUDE_PATH - Directories to include to use PAJENG
# PAJENG_LIBRARY_PATH - Files to link against to use PAJENG
# PAJENG_FOUND - When false, don't try to use PAJENG

# PAJENG_PATH can be used to make it simpler to find the various include
# directories and compiled libraries when PAJENG was not installed in the
# usual/well-known directories (e.g. because you made an in tree-source
# compilation or because you installed it in an "unusual" directory).
# Just set PAJENG_PATH it to your specific installation directory
